# MOVIE MARKET ANALYTICS
## Overview
This project analyzes data from leading movie industry sources to uncover data-driven insights that will guide our company in launching a successful movie studio.The goal is to identify top-performing genres and emerging trends at the box office. By leveraging these insights, the company can make informed decisions and strategically create films that are positioned for commercial success.

## Business Understanding
Our company wants to venture into the film industry but due to lack of prior experience we are faced with the following questions which are;

> **What type of films are most likely to succeed at the box office?**
> **What trends at the box office are associated with successful films?**

Therefore,every process done in this project aims to answer the questions above.

## Data understanding and analysis
### Datasets
The project utilises data sourced from the following websites;
> **Internet Movie Database(IMDb)**
> **Rotten Tomatoes**
> **Box office Mojo**
> **The Numbers**
> **The MovieDb**

## Methodology : Approach to Film Industry Analysis
To ensure thorough breakdown of the problem at hand, the project notebook shall follow the following structure;
1. **Data Exploration**
- Here the datasets will be loaded and examined to know their structure(number of columns and rows) ,the type of data in them.
- Checking of missing values and duplicated values is done in this stage.
- Descriptive statistic like min/max values will also be carried out for columns with numerical values.
2. **Data Cleaning**
- Handling of missing values through removal where necessary.
- Removing of duplicated rows
- Filtering the data by removing unneccessary columns that will not help us in our analysis.
3. **Data visualization and Analysis**
- Generation of useful visualizations to determine the trends in the industry.
- Check for relationships between different variables in the datasets.
- From this stage we can know whether or not to reject the Null Hypothesis.
4. **Business Recommendations**
- Finally from following the above steps when working with the datasets, we can insighfully
recommend concrete data-driven recommendations to support the success of the new movie studio.
